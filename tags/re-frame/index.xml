      <description>Web-dev &amp; Me: a non-story As much as I enjoy programming, and also spending (arguably too much) time on the web, I&#39;ve never really got into web development. I think part of the reason is that I associate it with JavaScript, which I just can&#39;t force myself to like, and all its associated tooling, which is monstrously complex.
So, except for tiny bits of js (typically some jQuery thing, and a couple of Rails apps done for some subjective test campaigns for web QoE a few years back) here and there, I&#39;ve mostly stayed away from web applications.</description>
