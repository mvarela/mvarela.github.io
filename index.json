My main field of expertise is Quality of Experience (QoE), which deals with how users experience the services they use. QoE is a very multidisciplinary field, spanning several technical domains such as networks, media, cloud, and web, as well as human aspects, including business. I am also knowledgeable on a number of other topics, such as Data Analysis, Predictive Models, Network Performance (QoS), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Software-defined Networks (SDN), and Network Management.\nI currently work at Metosin as a Senior Consultant, helping our customers develop elegant and efficient software solutions to their business problems. We specialize in Clojure, and related technologies. On top of my regular job at Metosin, I hold a part-time associated researcher position at the Institute for Software Technologies and Software Engineering of the University of Málaga, working on topics related to QoE. I also do freelance consulting on QoE, in particular for companies looking to develop QoE monitoring/management architectures for their media services.\nBetween 2020 and 2023, I worked at Profilence, building tools for test automation and profiling. I'm in charge of our new analytics back-end, shifting from batch processes to an online pipeline built on top of Kafka streams, and using XTDB (a bi-temporal Datalog DB), all on top of Clojure.\nBetween 2018 and 2019 I worked in the analytics team at callstats.io, figuring out how to understand and monitor QoE for WebRTC services. WebRTC brings significant challenges to the table when it comes to its QoE, as it comprises a variety of real-time, multi-party, multi-modal applications. This was an end-to-end process, from designing suitable quality models to implementing them in production (in Clojure and Java, in the context of a real-time, large-scale stream processing pipeline).\nIn the first half of 2017, I was a Senior Systems Engineer at EXFO, in the NFV team. My work revolved around the virtualization of network probes and their associated support infrastructure, and their integration into NFV architectures, notably ETSI NFV MANO. There were also performance issues to be addressed, due to moving the probes from specialized hardware to a COTS-based cloud context.\nUntil early 2017, I was a Principal Scientist at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, working in the Network Performance team, within the Communication Systems expert area.\nAt VTT, I was the lead for research in the QoE domain. Besides the traditional work on quality assessment for media services, I have also worked on other aspects of QoE, most notably QoE management, and the business and economic aspects of QoE.\nI have also worked on ways to define, understand and improve QoE for non-media services, in particular for Web-based services (WebQoE). This is particularly interesting for Cloud services, and work on this subject was spear-headed within the TIVIT Cloud Software Program. There are many possible applications for QoE estimators for generic services, ranging from SLA definition and enforcement, Operating Support Systems, datacenter management, and of course QoE optimization for the different services.\nA copy of my full CV can be found here.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"ac150fa3b9c53cd258e15ab840c0134c","permalink":"https://martin.varela.fi/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"author","summary":"I am an seasoned and results-oriented R\u0026D professional, with over 20 years of experience.

Being in a state of flow, one becomes more productive1, ideas become clearer, and good, elegant solutions to complex problems tend to come easily. Unfortunately, interruptions and changes of context can break this state of deep focus, and regaining it can take a (several minutes) long time. Again, this is likely a well-known issue for developers: your deep focus vanishes the minute a colleague asks a question, or your phone beeps, etc.\nSince being in flow is a good thing™, it stands to reason that anything that helps maintain that state is probably a useful tool to have, and things that disrupt it are probably best avoided.\nCaveat Lector In what follows I'll be making fairly strong assertions that are colored by my experience, my preferences, and my way of developing software. Some of those may or may not match your own, and you will possibly disagree with some of the stuff below. I hope you do, however, take away a clearer idea of the benefits of working with a proper REPL.\nTools and Their Impact In most commonly used programming languages, development follows a write-compile-run/test cycle2. This implies changing context at least once (to compile and run), most likely twice (if writing tests concurrently with the code).\nFor example, if working with Java or C#, you might write some method, and in order to test it, you will need a suitable test and possibly a test harness. The order in which you do these is not really relevant to this argument, but in any case both will be needed. This usually implies waiting for the code to build (usually fast, but still not instantaneous), and then waiting for the test to run (again, this takes some time). While this can be mitigated in some cases by having a test runner in the background, watching for changes, it still requires context changes and some time.\nIn languages with a proper REPL, such as Clojure and Common Lisp, we can write, run and test our code without leaving our editor window, and seeing the results in-place, and what's more important, we can do that incrementally, at the expression level. This allows for an extremely fluid development experience, in which we can immediately see the results of the code we are writing.\nFor example, let's say that part of what you need to do involves a regex. Regexes are typically (for me, at least) tricky to get right, so I may want to test the regex as I write it, against a bunch of possible inputs. If I was doing this in C#, I would probably write out my regex candidate, along with some scaffolding for the method I needed the regex for (if not the whole thing), plus one or more tests to check that the regex works as intended. Then I would run those tests (which takes some time), wait for them to finish, and look at the results to see if it needed more tweaking.\nIf I was working in Clojure, I would write out the regex, insert a rich comment form mapping something like re-find over a series of strings I want to match against, evaluate that, and fix as needed.\nFor example, let's say I need to match the strings \u0026quot;abctotod\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ab f\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ctotodfg\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ac d\u0026quot; \u0026quot;cd\u0026quot;. I may write out my regex and try it:\n(comment (let [rx #\u0026quot;[abc]+.*[def]$\u0026quot; targets [\u0026quot;abctotod\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ab f\u0026quot; \u0026quot;c totodfg\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ac d\u0026quot; \u0026quot;cd\u0026quot;]] (map (partial re-find rx) targets)) ;; =\u0026gt; (\u0026quot;abctotod\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ab f\u0026quot; nil \u0026quot;ac d\u0026quot; \u0026quot;cd\u0026quot;) ,)  I will immediately notice it's wrong (note that the evaluation occurred directly from the actual buffer I'm coding in, and the results were inserted as a comment by my editor tooling, this is a keystroke away), and I can fix it there on the spot, without switching context:\n(comment (let [rx #\u0026quot;[abc]+.*[defg]$\u0026quot; targets [\u0026quot;abctotod\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ab f\u0026quot; \u0026quot;c totodfg\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ac d\u0026quot; \u0026quot;cd\u0026quot;]] (map (partial re-find rx) targets)) ;; =\u0026gt; (\u0026quot;abctotod\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ab f\u0026quot; \u0026quot;c totodfg\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ac d\u0026quot; \u0026quot;cd\u0026quot;) ,)  This code can also be trivially extracted to its own test.\n(deftest regex-test (let [rx #\u0026quot;[abc]+.*[defg]$\u0026quot; targets [\u0026quot;abctotod\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ab f\u0026quot; \u0026quot;c totodfg\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ac d\u0026quot; \u0026quot;cd\u0026quot;] result (map (partial re-find rx) targets)] (is (true? (every? some? result)))))  Top-down, bottom-up, inside-out Lisps in general, and Clojure in particular, provide you with very flexible ways to think about and develop your software. I most often find myself working top-down when designing software, and implementing with a mix of bottom-up and top-down approaches. For example, once I have an idea of how an API should work and look like, I will start working from the data model, implementing the transformations needed to work the data I'm getting as arguments into the data I want to return as a result. This will often mean writing small functions (usually lambdas) to perform step-wise transformations on the data. I will generally use a threading macro to chain these together, and after verifying that they produce the desired outcome, I may swap the threading macro for a transducer-based solution, if it makes sense. Doing this while connected to the REPL, allows me to see the actual data transformation steps, and fix or modify them on the fly.\nOf all the approaches I've used for developing software, this is the one I've found to be most comfortable, and also the one I'm most productive with, as there is basically no context switching between programming and testing. It all happens at once, in the same place.\nFootnotes  Flow is not something specific to programming, it commonly occurs when doing other activities which require intense focus, such as gaming, art, or sports. ^ Eventually writing tests before, if you are TDD-inclined ^   ","date":1681412482,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1681412482,"objectID":"8b124d4aac1fab56f0cfb8d3a029a79d","permalink":"https://martin.varela.fi/2023/04/13/immersive-development-living-in-the-clojure-repl/","publishdate":"2023-04-13T21:01:22+02:00","relpermalink":"/2023/04/13/immersive-development-living-in-the-clojure-repl/","section":"post","summary":"Flow Anyone who has coded long enough has likely experienced what is commonly called flow, a state of intense focus, in which one is fully immersed in an activity.

One contribution of this article is to quantify and illustrate the trade-off between the QoE of video streaming services and CO2 emissions. Kleinrock's power metric from queuing theory is applied to find operational points and recommended video bitrates of the QoE-sustainability tradeoff. Furthermore, considering that networks and service delivery infrastructures are still in the process of transitioning towards 'green energy' consumption, we investigate the impact of 'green users' accepting certain quality degradations so as to reduce CO2 emissions.

Our objective is to provide a baseline of settings for similar studies in the future. The models we use are the N-Gram model, which is a classic approach in the field of natural language processing (NLP), and two deep learning (DL) models long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN). For datasets we used four datasets Profilence, BlueGene/L (BGL), Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and Hadoop. Other settings are the size of the sliding window which determines how many surrounding events we are using to predict a given event, mask position (the position within the window we are predicting), the usage of only unique sequences, and the portion of data that is used for training. The results show clear indications of settings that can be generalized across datasets. The performance of the DL models does not deteriorate as the window size increases while the N-Gram model shows worse performance with large window sizes on the BGL and Profilence datasets. Despite the popularity of Next Event Prediction, the results show that in this context it is better not to predict events at the edges of the subsequence, i.e., first or last event, with the best result coming from predicting the fourth event when the window size is five. Regarding the amount of data used for training, the results show differences across datasets and models. For example, the N-Gram model appears to be more sensitive toward the lack of data than the DL models. Overall, for similar experimental setups we suggest the following general baseline: Window size 10, mask position second to last, do not filter out non-unique sequences, and use a half of the total data for training.","tags":null,"title":"How to Configure Masked Event Anomaly Detection on Software Logs?","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1663833600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663833600,"objectID":"3a50dcc902ae80b48fe54b72532252e9","permalink":"https://martin.varela.fi/talk/talk-27/","publishdate":"2022-09-22T09:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/talk-27/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Beyond Grepping - Using AI in Pinpointing Anomaly Events in Stability Testing (joint presentation wiht Prof. Mika Mäntylä, from U.

Typically, rewards are defined based on system states and reflect the system’s perspective. From a user's point of view, it is important to consider the changing system conditions and dynamicity while the user consumes a service. In this paper, we consider online cloud gaming as use case. Cloud gaming essentially moves the processing power required to render a game away from the user into the cloud and streams the entire game experience to the user as a high definition video. According to the available network capacity, the video streaming bitrate is adapted. We conduct experiments on Google Stadia and provide a Markov model based on the measurement results to investigate a scenario where users are sharing a bottleneck link. The key contributions are proper definitions for (i) system-centric reward and (ii) user-centric reward of the cloud gaming model, as well as (iii) the analysis of the relationships between those metrics. Our key result allows a simple computation of the user-centric rewards. We provide (iv) numerical results on the trade-off between user-centric rewards and blocking probabilities to access the online cloud servers. We use Kleinrock's power metric to identify operational points.

We develop and evaluate two models for scoring individual log-events for anomalousness, namely an N-Gram model and a Deep Learning model with LSTM cells. Both are trained on normal log sequences only. We evaluate the models with long log sequences produced by stability testing in our company case and contrast that with very short log sequences from HDFS public dataset. We evaluate the prediction accuracy of the next event and computational efficiency. The N-Gram model is more accurate in stability testing logs (0.848 vs 0.831), whereas almost identical accuracy is seen in HDFS logs (0.849 vs 0.847). The N-Gram model has superior computational efficiency compared to the Deep model (4 to 13 seconds vs 16 minutes to nearly 4 hours), making it the preferred choice for our case company. Scoring individual log events for anomalousness seems like a good aid for root cause analysis of failing test cases, and our case company plans to add it to its online services.

Observable QoS conditions in the system may be assumed to follow a certain distribution, meaning that different end users will experience different conditions. On the other hand, drawing from the results of subjective user studies, we know that user diversity leads to distributions of user scores for any given test conditions (in this case referring to the QoS parameters of interest). Our previous studies have shown that to correctly derive various QoE metrics (e.g., Mean Opinion Score (MOS), quantiles, probability of users rating “good or better”, etc.) in a system under given conditions, there is a need to consider rating distributions obtained from user studies, which are often times not available. In this paper we extend these findings to show how to approximate user rating distributions given a QoS-to-MOS mapping function and second order statistics. Such a user rating distribution may then be combined with a QoS distribution observed in a system to finally derive corresponding distributions of QoE scores. We provide two examples to illustrate this process: 1) analytical results using a Web QoE model relating waiting times to QoE, and 2) numerical results using measurements relating packet losses to video stall pattern, which are in turn mapped to QoE estimates.","tags":null,"title":"From QoS Distributions to QoE Distributions: A Systems Perspective","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tobias Hoßfeld","Poul E.

Very often entries are incomplete, or repeated under different keys, or use inconsistent formatting (e.g., in how author names are handled, or titles capitalized).\nI've been thinking a bit about how to lower the friction of dealing with these issues (and also finding a practical motivation to get some extra-curricular coding done), and part of the solution I have in mind is clj-bibtex, a small library for operating on BibTeX data.\nBasically, the use case I have in mind for this is to load up a bunch of bibliography data, do some basic normalization on it (in particular author names), and load it into a Datascript DB, where I can easily query the data.\nIt is often the case that author names in BibTeX entries are misspelled, or that a \"Last, F.\" format is used instead of \"Last, First\", etc. I would like to quickly identify these cases, and later be able to merge those entities (in the DB) so that a canonical name is available for each author. Likewise, it is common for duplicate entries to find their way into .bib files, with different keys and small differences in the title fields (different capitalization styles is a typical issue).\nIn order to solve these two issues, I had to look at string similarity metrics.\nThe problem What I needed to do then is find a way, given two strings, to see how similar they are. This is a problem that has been solved many times over, so I was not about to invent a new similarity metric, but rather find one that worked well in this particular context, and was simple (and preferably easy!) to implement.\nThe canonical string similarity (or distance) metric is the Levenshtein distance, which is a so-called edit distance metric. Quoting the wiki, this metric is\n\"the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other.\"\nThere are a number of other edit distance metrics, which allow different operations to be considered, and hence work better or worse for different use cases. For this use case, the Damerau-Levenshtein metric could be a better fit, since it also allows for letter transposition (which is a common typo).\nUpon closer inspection, I noticed that none of these algorithms lent itself to a nice, efficient and TCO-friendly implementation. They can of course be implemented with loop or as a reduction, carrying a rather large accumulator, but I was feeling a bit lazy, and I suspected the end result would not be very nice to look at, so I decided to look around a bit more. A few more minutes of googling brought me to the Sørensen-Dice coefficient, which is, per the wiki:\n\"a statistic used to gauge the similarity of two samples\"\nand is defined as, given two sets $X$ and $Y$\n$$ SDC = \\frac{2\\vert X \\cap Y \\vert}{\\vert X \\vert + \\vert Y \\vert} $$\nThe solution In order to make this work for strings, we need to somehow tokenize them. Using single letters, or words, is unlikely to yield the results we want, but if we consider digrams 2, it produces very good results for the problem we are trying to solve. As a bonus, the implementation is trivial.\nFirst, we need to turn our strings into a set of digrams:\n(require '[net.cgrand.xforms :as x]) (defn digrams \u0026quot;Creates a set of all digrams in `s`\u0026quot; [s] (let [xform (comp (x/partition 2 1) (map #(apply str %)))] (into #{} xform s)))  Then, we can simply use the resulting sets in the definition of the Sørensen-Dice coefficient (noting that it's undefined if both strings are empty, and that when either string is of length 1, the coefficient will either be 0, if the strings are different, or 1)\n(require '[clojure.set :as set]) (defn sorensen-dice \u0026quot;Computes the Sørenson-Dice coefficient between `s1` and `s2`.

So I finally had a compelling reason to properly use some Clojurescript, and learn a bit about Reagent and re-frame, which I'd been meaning to look into for a while.\nLong story short, I found the re-frame approach conceptually very nice, and quite simple to pick up. The prototype for work, which had started as a couple of simple reagent components was a suitable case study for a few hours over the weekend, and all was well... Except now I'd been bitten by the web bug.\nBrowsing around on YouTube, I came across this cool talk by Douglas Hamilton, showcasing his threeagent project, which provides a reagent-like API wrapper for three.js. So, we can use the same approach for the \"web page\" parts, and the 3D ones, which is super neat.\nSince I'm not a gifted 3D designer, I chose to do a toy project that's almost, but not quite 2d: a clock.\n  \nVoilà, the unnecessarily-3d clock! It's built in parts: there's the face, the hands, the little knob in the middle, and the ticks on the face. Each of those components is based on a few three.js primitives provided by threeagent. So the ticks are built like this:\n(defn ticks [props-in radius length pos-z] (let [props (merge {:color \u0026quot;black\u0026quot; :opacity 0.8 :transparent true} props-in) positions (mapv (fn[i] (let [angle (subs/hand-angle (* 5 i)) pos-x (* radius (js/Math.cos angle)) pos-y (* radius (js/Math.sin angle))] [:box {:position [pos-x pos-y pos-z] :rotation [0 0 (+ (/ js/Math.PI 2) angle)] :width 0.2 :depth 0.1 :height length :material props}])) (range 12))] `[:object ~@positions]))  The hours and minutes hands are handled by this function:\n(defn hand [material-props unit-key length] (let [props (merge {:color \u0026quot;black\u0026quot; :opacity 0.8 :transparent true} material-props) units (re-frame/subscribe [unit-key]) angle (subs/hand-angle @units) [pos-x pos-y] (subs/hand-offsets length angle)] [:object {:position [pos-x pos-y] :rotation [0 0 angle]} [:box {:position [0 0 -10.5] :width 0.4 :height length :depth 0.1 :material props}]]))  We can manage the state of the 3D bits in the same way (re-frame's app-db) as we manage the state of the app itself. This is pretty cool! The full source is up on GitHub, if you're curious.\nSome re-frame bits (the 30,000ft. view) Re-frame brings order into the app, allowing us to cleanly separate the state (which is centralized in the app-db), the views (which are along the lines of the code above), and events, which make things happen. Events are triggered (in this toy example, there's only one event type, and it's triggered by a timer), and are handled by pure functions (event-handlers), usually changing the state of the application. If side-effects are needed (e.g., either as a result of the event, or as in input to the event handler), they are handled separately, via effects and coeffects, respectively. This sounds a bit overly complicated, but keeping the event handlers pure does make it easier to reason about and test the application. In order to update the UI, the views subscribe to bits of the app state (or values derived from them, via so-called reactive subscriptions). When those are updated by an event handler, the views are re-rendered as needed.\nSo basically, the different concerns in the app are neatly separated, and there is a clear way in which information flows: components can trigger events, which affect the state of the application (and potentially also trigger further events), and that state is propagated, via subscriptions, to the components, which can then update themselves.\nIf you haven't looked into re-frame before, you can have a go at its docs, there's a lot of info to get started there.\nInteractive development A nice thing about Clojurescript is that it has good tooling for live coding. Besides the REPL, you can get live hot reloading of your app, while maintaining application state. For this, I used Thomas Heller's shadow-cljs, which handles this neatly (as well as the rest of the build process, and provides easy integration with the node.js ecosystem).\nThis is particularly handy when developing the views, as you can simply save the file and the app will be reloaded automatically, so your changes are immediately visible.\nIt's nice to have the same type of workflow as when working on Clojure, it greatly helps boost your productivity.\n\n","date":1572639503,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572639503,"objectID":"843a23b175ecb89f35bd48fba2001360","permalink":"https://martin.varela.fi/2019/11/01/webgl-react-and-no-javascript/","publishdate":"2019-11-01T22:18:23+02:00","relpermalink":"/2019/11/01/webgl-react-and-no-javascript/","section":"post","summary":"Web-dev \u0026 Me: a non-story As much as I enjoy programming, and also spending (arguably too much) time on the web, I've never really got into web development.

Prominent examples address adaptive video streaming services, as well as enabling technologies for QoE-aware service management and monitoring, such as SDN/NFV and machine learning.

QoE sits at a confluence point between several disciplines, and one of those is QoS. Back when I started working on these topics, \"QoE\" was not a thing, we (networking people) would talk about \"QoS from the user's perspective\", or similar kludgy terms, for lack of a proper one. The underlying concept, however, was clear: how does QoS in the network affect the user's perception of media quality.\nBack then, media quality had an implicit narrower meaning, too. VoIP was a new thing, and doing real-time video was mostly a research topic. Times change, technology advances, and QoE has taken a life of its own, evolving into a wider, much more inclusive concept spanning a much wider range of application domains.\nFor some applications of QoE, however, the link to QoS, and more generally, performance, remains strong. In particular, when dealing with monitoring and management, we are most often interested in understanding how the performance of the network and other resources affect the users' QoE.\nWe typically see QoS as a lower-level construct, which in practice provides one of the foundations of QoE; hence the plethora of so-called QoS to QoE models in the literature. These map stuff we can measure (e.g., network QoS), and stuff we know (encoding parameters, buffer sizes, etc.) into an approximation of how an ideal, average user (or if we did our homework and put some effort, a population of users) might experience the quality of a given service. It seems clear that, in a sense, QoE sits atop QoS, but is it really so?\nA Different Perspective Over the last few years I have often worked on QoE management ideas, and over the past year in particular, I have focused on quality monitoring for WebRTC platforms. One common idea that comes up in this context, is that of \"service-level QoE\", or \"the QoE of the system\", or similar terms. Like in the old times, we seem to lack a proper term to describe what we are after, despite it being a rather intuitive thing.\nOn the other hand, based on the definition of QoE, it seems rather absurd to speak of \"the system's QoE\", since QoE is all about the user. A system (or a service) cannot experience anything, it has neither expectations, nor an emotional state, nor a sensory system, for that matter.\nSo when we speak about \"service-level QoE\", we are, at best abusing the language, or at worst, severely confused about what QoE is. Since most of the people I know who work on these topics are pretty knowledgeable about QoE, I'll go with the first explanation. We are abusing the language, because we lack a suitable term for what we are working on.\nLet us illustrate this a bit with WebRTC. At callstats.io we provide a WebRTC monitoring service; our users often have several WebRTC applications, and each application often sees hundreds, or thousands of calls a day. Calls can have many users, and each of those users will experience a certain quality while in the call. So far, so good, we have users, and each user's QoE can be estimated to some degree (remember kids, WebRTC is a hard problem, QoE-wise!).\nBut our goal is to provide a call QoE value, and furthermore, an application QoE value to our users (who are not the actual users on the call, but the service providers). While the terms themselves are rather nonsensical when going by the QoE definition, their intent seems quite clear: we want to know if a call was good or bad for the users, and we want to know this for all calls across a given WebRTC service, to see if the service itself is performing as expected (i.e., providing its users with a good experience!).\nTroubles ahead This pattern repeats itself in most, if not all of the QoE management literature, where the goal is to understand, and improve the performance of a service, and said performance is dependent on the quality experienced by the service's users.\nBehind this seemingly innocent idea, there lies a mountain of complications, unfortunately. Our understanding of this \"Service-level QoE\" can take different forms, depending on the type of service, our goals, and a host of other factors.\nThe main idea boils down to figuring out how to create quality aggregates that allow us to build a notion of service quality on top of the individual users' QoE. When digging a bit deeper, we soon encounter temporal issues (pooling QoE over varying time scales), modeling issues (MOS vs. quantiles/distributions), finding trends in distribution variations, etc.\nWhat's next? I suspect (and hope) we will see more work on this topic over the coming years, eventually converging towards a proper definition for this idea of Quality of Service (nice term, but too loaded to use, isn't it?).\nWorking on WebRTC has yielded some insight on aggregating quality, but it's not yet mature enough, nor general enough to put it out there as a solution candidate for this problem.\nFor the time being, service-level QoE aggregates might be a good first-order approximation to putting a name to this idea, though a bit lacking in the marketing department.\n","date":1556048903,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556048903,"objectID":"00f4fa600b885799f92bc295319526bd","permalink":"https://martin.varela.fi/2019/04/23/coming-full-circle/","publishdate":"2019-04-23T22:48:23+03:00","relpermalink":"/2019/04/23/coming-full-circle/","section":"post","summary":"In the Beginning...

As a result, a divergence is introduced between the predicted and the actual QoE, the later being affected by the reaction of the user to resource assignments. We believe the following two factors to be among those having the highest impact in this respect: the user (im)patience, and tolerance to low quality. To illustrate our claims, we model an example scenario where a user requests an online service, such as an online authentication service. The request is processed by a system with limited resources, which may also cause the request to be blocked or buffered, with a consequent impact on the QoE. Some aspects of aborting users, blocked users, and QoE of served users are investigated by means of a simple queueing system, M/M/s/n + M, which takes impatience into account. Insights from this theoretical study show that an increase in the user patience results in a decrease of the average QoE in the system, as the user may consume system resources without waiting to be finally served. Based on these findings, we argue the importance of incorporating these aspects of quality, often ignored in both QoE modeling and management, into any QoE management system that is expected to improve the provider’s bottom line","tags":null,"title":"The Interplay between QoE, User Behavior and System Blocking in QoE Management","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536440400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536440400,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"https://martin.varela.fi/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":["Tobias Hoßfeld","Martín Varela","Poul Einar Heegaard","Lea Skorin-Kapov"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1527306042,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527306042,"objectID":"51987ed5088ec361d71a8f5321a75a82","permalink":"https://martin.varela.fi/publication/varela-qoem-2018/","publishdate":"2018-05-26T06:40:42+03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/varela-qoem-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Quality of Experience (QoE) has received much attention over the past years and has become a prominent issue for delivering services and applications.

A significant amount of research has been devoted to understanding, measuring, and modelling QoE for a variety of media services. The next logical step is to actively exploit that accumulated knowledge to improve and manage the quality of multimedia services, while at the same time ensuring efficient and cost-effective network operations. Moreover, with many different players involved in the end-to-end service delivery chain, identifying the root causes of QoE impairments and finding effective solutions for meeting the end users' requirements and expectations in terms of service quality is a challenging and complex problem. In this paper we survey state-of-the-art findings and present emerging concepts and challenges related to managing QoE for networked multimedia services. Going beyond a  number of previously published survey papers addressing the topic of QoE management, we address QoE management in the context of ongoing developments, such as the move to softwarized networks, the exploitation of big data analytics and machine learning, and the steady rise of new and immersive services (e.g., augmented and virtual reality). We address the implications of such paradigm shifts in terms of new approaches in QoE modeling, and the need for novel QoE monitoring and management infrastructures.

Here, key issues arise from gaps of different information contexts involved, which have to be managed when introducing a QoE product. Hence, this paper analyzes the double role of prices for quality perception as well as the impact of QoE on user demand with the help of a fixed point model. Our model is consistent with real-world user behavior that we have observed during comprehensive user trials on quality perception for Video on Demand services. Based on these results, we propose a simple approach for convergence-based user classification, and discuss the complementarity of Willingness-to-Pay vs. subjective quality perception in service purchasing situations.","tags":null,"title":"What You Pay Is What You Get? — Fundamentals of Charging Internet Services Based on End User Quality of Experience","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tobias Hoßfeld","Martín Varela","Poul Einar Heegaard","Lea Skorin-Kapov"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1519616442,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519616442,"objectID":"ebc164eb608828e587edefdc5b760db1","permalink":"https://martin.varela.fi/publication/varela-mmb18/","publishdate":"2018-02-26T06:40:42+03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/varela-mmb18/","section":"publication","summary":"Queueing systems following a first-in-first-out (FIFO) strategy are well understood and various results are known for the response time of the system. However, the question arises how the results look like when taking into account a user-centric point of view. To this end, an M/M/1-FIFO system is investigated for the setup of different Internet services. In this tutorial paper, the impact of the system's delay on Quality of Experience (QoE) is considered for 1) YouTube video (initial playout delay), 2) authentication in social networks, 3) wireless 3G Internet connection setup. Existing QoE models are used to map the response time in the system, corresponding to the waiting time for users until the service is setup, to Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) as a measure of QoE. The system is then evaluated in terms of overall QoE and QoE fairness for the three services considered, under different load scenarios. The results show how different such systems and response times are perceived by users of different services. Further, the dimensioning of FIFO systems with respect to QoE only requires us to consider the overall QoE.","tags":null,"title":"QoE Analysis of the Setup of Different Internet Services for FIFO Server Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tobias Hoßfeld","Poul Einar Heegaard","Lea Skorin-Kapov","Martín Varela"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1518147642,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1518147642,"objectID":"8a66cdc60ff5355644169315af1673c3","permalink":"https://martin.varela.fi/publication/varela-quex18/","publishdate":"2018-02-09T06:40:42+03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/varela-quex18/","section":"publication","summary":"The user-centric management of networks and services focuses on the Quality of Experience (QoE) as perceived by the end user. In general, the goal is to maximize (or at least ensure an acceptable) QoE, while ensuring fairness among users, e.g., in terms of resource allocation and scheduling in shared systems. A problem arising in this context is that the notions of fairness commonly applied in the QoS domain do not translate well to the QoE domain. We have recently proposed a QoE fairness index $F$, which solves these issues. In this paper, we provide a detailed rationale for it, along with a thorough comparison of the proposed index and its properties against the most widely used QoS fairness indices, showing its advantages.

In this part, we will look at two other types of fractals. The first one, is called the Barnsley fern, and unlike the L-systems in the previous post, it is based not on string substitution, but on the repeated iteration of affine transformations to a starting point. The second fractal we'll cover in this post is the Mandelbrot set, which may well be the \"most famous\" fractal out there, and for good reason, as it it really fascinating.\nBetween Many Ferns The Barnsley fern is built by applying, in an iterative fashion, a series of affine transformations to a point. The transformations are chosen randomly between four possible ones, and the probability of choosing each one at each iteration is given by a fixed distribution, as follows.\n   Transformation Probability   $f1$ 0.01   $f2$ 0.85   $f3$ 0.07   $f4$ 0.07    Each transformation has the form $Av^\\intercal + w$, where $A$ is a $2\\times2$ matrix, $v=(x,y)$ is the point being transformed, and $w$ is a constant vector. If $A$ is of the form $$ \\begin{pmatrix} a\u0026b \\\\ c\u0026d \\end{pmatrix}$$ and $w$ is of the form $$ \\begin{pmatrix} e \\\\ f\\end{pmatrix}$$ then we have $$f(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} ax + by + e \\\\ cx + dy + f \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe coefficients for the $f1\\cdots f4$ transformations are as follows:\n   Transforms   Coeff.       a b c d e f   $f1$ 0 0 0 0.16 0 0   $f2$ 0.85 0.04 -0.04 0.85 0 1.6   $f3$ 0.2 -0.26 0.23 0.22 0 1.6   $f4$ -0.15 0.28 0.26 0.24 0 0.44    We can start putting this to code, by defining the transformations and their application:\n(ns fractals.barnsley (:require [fractals.util :as util] ;; We'll use a helper to scale the plot to the canvas [hiccup.core :as hiccup])) ;; And hiccup to generate the HTML/SVG (def transforms {:f1 [0 0 0 0.16 0 0] :f2 [0.85 0.04 -0.04 0.85 0 1.6] :f3 [0.2 -0.26 0.23 0.22 0 1.6] :f4 [-0.15 0.28 0.26 0.24 0 0.44]}) (defn- apply-transform [point coeffs] (if (empty? coeffs) [0 0] (let [[x y] point [a b c d e f] coeffs xx (+ (* a x) (* b y) e) yy (+ (* c x) (* d y) f)] [xx yy])))  With that done, we can proceed to implement the actual Barnsley fern fractal. First, we pick the transformations with the given probability distribution\n(defn- transform-probs [i] (cond (\u0026lt;= i 0.01) :f1 (\u0026lt;= i (+ 0.01 0.85)) :f2 (\u0026lt;= i (+ 0.01 0.85 0.07)) :f3 :true :f4))  We can now iterate on our starting point, for however many iterations we want to do.\n(defn barnsley-fern [num-points] (let [probs (repeatedly num-points rand) coeflist (map (comp transforms transform-probs) probs)] (reductions apply-transform [0 0] coeflist)))  Basically, what we are doing is choosing a sequence of transformations to apply (randomly, according to the given distribution), and then reducing the actual transformation, starting on the origin, and keeping all intermediate results. This gives us a list of points of the form $(f_{i_1}(0,0),f_{i_2}(f_{i_1}(0,0)), f_{i_3}(f_{i_2}(f_{i_1}(0,0))), \\cdots)$, where each $i_j \\in {1,2,3,4}$.\nAll that is left to do now is render this series of points. We'll do them as tiny SVG circles, similar to how we did with polylines for the L-system fractals in the previous post.\n(defn- render-svg-points [plot-points size] (let [xmlns \u0026quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026quot; style \u0026quot;stroke:#5f7f5fBB; fill:#5f7f5fBB;\u0026quot; scale-bf (fn [[x y]] [(* 100 x) (* 100 y)]) points (util/fix-coords (map scale-bf plot-points) size) do-circle (fn [pt] (let [[x y] pt] [:circle {:cx (str x) :cy (str y) :r \u0026quot;0.2\u0026quot; :style style}])) circles (vec (conj (map do-circle points) :g))] (hiccup/html [:html [:div {:padding 25} [:svg {:width size :height size :xmlns xmlns} circles]]]))) (defn do-BF [num-points] (spit \u0026quot;barnsley-fern.html\u0026quot; (render-svg-points (barnsley-fern num-points) 40000)))  Running this with 40K points renders the following.\nThe actual SVG can be found here.\nIt is interesting to see how the whole pattern repeats in each leaf portion. Looking closer, we can find the whole fern leaf repeated in each part of itself.\nAnd Now for the Main Attraction... The Mandelbrot set is a favorite of mine, and I have to admit that when writing the code for this renderer, I spent much more time than I had expected just playing with it, really fascinated by its complexity and beauty.\nThe Mandelbrot set $M$ is defined on the complex plane, as those points $c$ for which the following recurrence remains bounded: $$ z_{n+1} = z^2_n + c$$ with $z_0 = 0$.\nIn particular, $c \\in M$ if $\\limsup\\limits_{n\\rightarrow \\infty}\\left|z_n\\right| \\leq 2$.\nIn software, we can only approximate the limit of this recurrence with a given number of iterations, which we refer to as depth. The deeper we iterate, the more detail we will obtain in our rendering of the set. A basic approach to generating the set would consist of defining a depth, a section of the complex plane where the points we consider will be, and a mapping from a set of pixels to these points. We then calculate, for each pixel, whether the recurrence diverges or remains bounded within the given number of iterations, and then assign a boolean value to whether the point represented by the pixel belongs to the set.\nWe can do a bit better, by considering, instead of a binary value, the number of iterations that it took for the recurrence to diverge at each point not in the set. This allows for a bit more nuanced representation when we render it.\nIn code:\n(ns fractals.mandelbrot (:require [com.evocomputing.colors :as c] ;; we'll use the HSV space for coloring [clojure.string :refer [join]]) (:import [java.io File] [javax.imageio ImageIO] [java.awt Color] [java.awt.image BufferedImage])) ;; some java interop for rendering PNGs (defn- square-z [r i] [(- (* r r) (* i i)) (* 2 r i)]) (defn- in-mandelbrot? [point iter] \u0026quot;This function will return 0 if the point is in the set, and otherwise, the number of remaining iterations remaining (out of the original maximum), if the point 'escapes' from the set\u0026quot; (let [values (iterate #(map + point (square-z (first %) (second %))) [0 0]) test (fn[acc [r i]] (if (or (\u0026gt;= acc iter) (\u0026gt; (+ (* r r)(* i i)) 4)) (reduced acc) (inc acc))) counted (reduce test 0 values)] (- iter counted)))  In order to actually render the set, we need a bit more work, as we need to define the mapping of our view-port to a section of the complex plane.\n(defn- scale-to-bounds \u0026quot;This function takes a point [x y] in an plot area [[0 0] [xmax ymax]], and maps it to a bounding box in the real plane where the plotting will be done. The bounding box is defined by its lower left and upper right corners, and in practice, should not be much larger than [[-2.5 -1] [1 1]], which is where the fun stuff happens\u0026quot; [point img-size bounding-box] (let [[x y] point [xmax ymax] img-size [[b-x-min b-y-min][b-x-max b-y-max]] bounding-box bx-span (- b-x-max b-x-min) by-span (- b-y-max b-y-min) xx (- (* bx-span (/ x xmax)) (Math/abs b-x-min)) yy (- (* by-span (/ y ymax)) (Math/abs b-y-min))] [xx yy])) (defn mandelbrot [size bounding-box depth] (let [[xmax ymax] size points (for [y (range ymax) x (range xmax)] [x y]) f (fn[i](-\u0026gt; i (scale-to-bounds size bounding-box) (in-mandelbrot? depth)))] (pmap f points)))  With these two functions, we have now a representation we can use for plotting. We can map the view-port to a section of the plane with the ~scale-to-bounds~ function, and then for each point in the view-port, calculate the number of iterations it took to diverge. This code is simple to understand, but not really efficient. I suspect there's a bit of stream fusion that could be applied here (possibly using transducers in Clojure), or otherwise switch to using mutable state, but for the sake of simplicity, I'd rather have this pure version for now.\nNow we can render our set. As a first approach, we could simply use the PPM ASCII format, which is trivial to implement without any external library:\n(defn do-ppm [points size depth name] (let [[x y] size contents (-\u0026gt;\u0026gt; points (partition x) (reverse) ;; otherwise we mirror on the x axis (map #(join \u0026quot; \u0026quot; (map str %))) (interpose \u0026quot;\\n\u0026quot;) (apply str) ) header (str \u0026quot;P2\\n\u0026quot; (str x) \u0026quot; \u0026quot; (str y) \u0026quot;\\n\u0026quot; (str depth) \u0026quot;\\n\u0026quot;)] (spit name (str header contents))))  The above code is nothing fancy, but it gets us something to look at (and even within Emacs!):\nThis is pretty cool! However, we can easily do better. We will use a bit of our host platform to render color PNGs. This will require two things, firstly, mapping the values we have to color values, and secondly, rendering the PNG itself. Since we have a sort of \"intensity\" value for each pixel, in the form of the number of iterations, we will calculate the color in the HSV space, using a fixed hue and saturation, and scaling the number of iterations to the value of the color. This will render the points in the set in black, and those not in it in different shades.\n(defn do-color [i depth] (let [icorr (/ (* i 100.0) depth) [r g b] (c/hsl-to-rgb 205 100 icorr)] (bit-or (bit-shift-left r 16) (bit-shift-left g 8) b))) (defn do-png [points size depth name] (ImageIO/write (let [width (first size) height (second size) pts (-\u0026gt;\u0026gt; points (partition width) (reverse) ;; the y axies grows \u0026quot;downwards\u0026quot; in the PNG (map vec) (vec)) out (new BufferedImage width height BufferedImage/TYPE_3BYTE_BGR)] (doseq [x (range width) y (range height)] (.setRGB out x y (do-color (get-in pts [y x]) depth))) out) \u0026quot;png\u0026quot; (new File name )))  Now we have some colors, but to be honest, the result is a bit underwhelming...\nOne thing we can realize, is that most of the \"interesting\" parts of the render happen around the limits of the set, so we can modify our coloring function to reflect that. We do this by making the middle of the iteration range the brightest, and then decrease the value as we move towards the edges of the range. For a bit more \"drama\", we also treat the saturation similarly. We redefine then our do-color function:\n(defn do-color \u0026quot;Maps a new color with the value based on the number of iterations it took for the point to escape the set. The plain mapping is rather dull, so here we focus on the points which are in the boundaries (intuitively, those that took long to escape, but not longest). We calculate the value as the distance to the middle value, which results in a nice 'electric' look around the edges of the set\u0026quot; [i depth] (let [ icorr (/ (* i 100.0) depth) l (- 100 (* 2 (Math/abs (- 50 icorr)))) s (- 100 (* 1.3 (Math/abs (- 50 icorr)))) [r g b] (c/hsl-to-rgb 205 s l)] (bit-or (bit-shift-left r 16) (bit-shift-left g 8) b)))  Now this looks much better! Arguably, the color of the points that diverge very early could be made lighter, but I like the aesthetics this coloring function gives. In any case, there are a huge number of possible ways to apply color.\nWith a suitable rendering mechanism, now we can explore a bit the set, and start looking into interesting portions. We can \"zoom in\" as much as we want, by defining suitable bounding boxes, and we can increase the detail by increasing the depth. For example, we can take a closer look at the so-called Seahorse valley.\nI find this area of the plane truly fascinating, the patterns and depth of it are quite something. To give you an idea, here is a 24 megapixel render, with a depth of 2000 iterations. Go on, click on it, and zoom in to its full size. I'll wait for you here.\n\nIs that wonderful, or what?\nJust One More Thing In order to appreciate the Mandelbrot set in all its splendor, it would be nice to be able to \"fall\" into it, with an animation. Given that we have a way to render a view-port onto any area of the plane, it's not much more effort to do it for a set of areas along a path, with different magnification levels.\nWe will basically start with a target image size (and implied aspect ratio), centered around a point, and with a given surface area on the complex plane. We will then choose another point and another target surface area where the last frame will be centered. All we need to do now is to create the required number of bounding boxes, interpolating position and size over the number of frames to render. Going back to our code:\n(ns fractals.animate (:require [fractals.mandelbrot :as m] [clojure.math.numeric-tower :as nt])) (defn interpolate-centers [start-point end-point nframes] (let [[xs ys] start-point [xe ye] end-point delta-x (- xe xs) delta-y (- ye ys) step (/ (Math/sqrt (+ (nt/expt delta-x 2) (nt/expt delta-y 2))) nframes) theta (Math/atan2 delta-y delta-x) next-center (fn [[x y]] [(+ x (* step (Math/cos theta))) (+ y (* step (Math/sin theta)))])] (take (inc nframes) (iterate next-center start-point)))) (defn interpolate-areas [start-area ratio nframes] (let [step (nt/expt ratio (/ 1.0 nframes))] (take (inc nframes) (iterate #(/ % step) start-area)))) (defn bounding-box [aspect-ratio area center] (let [[x y] center dim-y (nt/sqrt (/ area aspect-ratio)) dim-x (* dim-y aspect-ratio) delta-y (/ dim-y 2) delta-x (/ dim-x 2)] [[(- x delta-x) (- y delta-y)] [(+ x delta-x) (+ y delta-y)]])) (defn animate-mandelbrot [img-width img-height depth start-point end-point start-area zoom-factor nframes] (let [centers (interpolate-centers start-point end-point nframes) areas (interpolate-areas start-area zoom-factor nframes) aspect-ratio (/ img-width img-height) size [img-width img-height] b-boxes (map (partial bounding-box aspect-ratio) areas centers) names (map (partial format \u0026quot;mb-frame-%04d.png\u0026quot;) (range)) fracs (map #(m/mandelbrot size % depth) b-boxes)] (dorun (pmap #(m/do-png %1 size depth %2) fracs names))))  This code technically has a bug, in that when the center position moves across the x axis, the movement mirrors in the rendering (because of how the y axis increases \"downwards\" on the PNG render), resulting in an angled path, instead of a straight one. Despite this being simple to fix, I'll call this a feature, and leave it in, as it allows for some interesting zooms that would otherwise require a more generic approach to constructing paths .\nHere is a full-HD clip of us \"falling into the Seahorse Valley\". The magnification factor here is 2400x. \nThat's All, Folks! I hope you have enjoyed these posts on fractals as much as I enjoyed writing them, they were really a lot of fun to play with!

I remember seeing a render of a Mandelbrot set back in the early 90s (when color screens started being accessible back home), and being completely mesmerized by it. I remember being even more fascinated by seeing a code-golf version of such a renderer, implemented in some 300 bytes of C.\nSome days ago I came across the \"dragon curve\", and decided to give it a go in Clojure, as a way to learn a bit more and have some fun. I implemented it as a Lindenmayer system, which reveals the simplicity behind it.\nL-systems are string re-writing systems, and have a set of constants, variables, rules, and a starting axiom. One starts with the axiom, and applies the rules to it. Each rule maps a variable to a new string that substitutes it. Constants are unaffected by the re-write, and remain in place.\nIn the case of the dragon curve, it can be represented by the following L-system (described nicely in the wiki):\n variables : X Y constants : F + − start : FX rules : X → X+YF+ Y → −FX−Y  In order to \"grow\" the dragon, we iterate by applying the rules to the axiom, and then to the result, and so on. For example, after two iterations on the axiom, we have:\n   Iteration 1      Axiom FX    Rule for X FX+YF+   Iteration 2      Rule for X FX+YF++YF+    Rule for Y FX+-FX-YF++-FX-YF+    These simple rules, and the simple starting point lead to an increasingly complex string, where structure starts becoming visible. Of course, doing this by hand is extremely tedious, so we can automate it with a bit of Clojure.\nWe can start by defining the axiom, and the re-writing rules.\n(ns dragon.core (:require [hiccup.core :as hiccup])) (def start [:F :X]) (defn rewrite [i] (cond (= :X i) [:X :+ :Y :F :+] (= :Y i) [:- :F :X :- :Y] :true [i]))  We can now see what happens when we apply the rules to the axiom:\n(map rewrite start)  ([:F] [:X :+ :Y :F :+])  This is a bit noisy due to the brackets, but we can see it's the same result we got by iterating by hand. Let's add a bit more functionality:\n(defn dragon [segments iter] (if (zero? iter) segments (let [segs (vec (mapcat rewrite segments))] (recur segs (- iter 1)))))  Now we can get rid of the extra brackets, and do some more iterations.\n(map (partial dragon start) (range 4))  ([:F :X] [:F :X :+ :Y :F :+] [:F :X :+ :Y :F :+ :+ :- :F :X :- :Y :F :+] [:F :X :+ :Y :F :+ :+ :- :F :X :- :Y :F :+ :+ :- :F :X :+ :Y :F :+ :- :- :F :X :- :Y :F :+])  As we can see in the (slightly reformatted) results, the string's size and complexity keeps increasing.\nIn order to visualize this fractal, we need some rules on how to interpret it. This is also very simple, and in fact, it is pretty much the same as the turtle graphics that were used in the Logo language.\nIn this case, we will interpret the F constant as forward (that is, draw a line in the direction the turtle is facing, and a fixed distance). The + and - constants will respectively mean right 90 and left 90, that is, to rotate the turtle by 90 degrees in a given direction. And that's all there is to it (for now, anyway).\nWe can again automate this quite easily:\n(def pi:2 (/ Math/PI 2)) (def vec:size 3) (defn points [segments theta acc x y] (if (empty? segments) acc (let [s (first segments) xs (rest segments)] (cond (or (= s :X) (= s :Y)) (recur xs, theta, acc, x, y) (= s :+) (recur xs, (+ theta pi:2), acc, x, y) (= s :-) (recur xs, (- theta pi:2), acc, x, y) (= s :F) (let [xx (+ x (* vec:size (Math/cos theta))) yy (+ y (* vec:size (Math/sin theta))) new-acc (conj acc (vector xx yy))] (recur xs, theta, new-acc, xx, yy))))))  We basically go over the generated string, and interpret it according to the rules described above (ignore constants, draw when we find an F, and turn in the indicated direction when we find a + or a -. This gives us a list of points which we can then use to build an SVG polyline.\n(defn render-svg [plot-points] (let [width 1000 height 1000 xmlns \u0026quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026quot; style \u0026quot;stroke:#474674; fill:white;\u0026quot; points (apply str (map #(str (first %) \u0026quot;,\u0026quot; (second %) \u0026quot; \u0026quot;) plot-points))] (hiccup/html [:svg {:width width :height height :xmlns xmlns} [:polyline {:points points :style style}]])))  Here we are using the hiccup library for rendering HTML, and creating a (potentially very large) polyline element with all the points we defined above.\nNow we can render our dragon and enjoy it in all its glory!\n(let [d (dragon start 15) pts (points d 0 [] 500 500) html (render-svg pts)] (spit \u0026quot;dragon15.html\u0026quot; html)  If you are reading this in a modern browser with proper SVG support, you can also open the generated HTML output.\nTidying Up The code snippets above are fun for playing in the Clojure REPL, but they're don't generalize well, and can be improved upon significantly. In particular, they require some fiddling with the SVG rendering view-port and the starting point of the fractal drawing. I've cleaned up the code a bit, and made it generic so it can support many other L-systems. It now lives on Github, along with some other fractal code that we'll discuss in an upcoming post.\nThe L-system code itself, if you are interested, lives here.\nMore Fractal Goodness Lindenmayer systems can give rise to very many interesting fractals, and many self-similar constructs can also be represented as L-systems. Below you can see some of these.\nBox Fractal axiom : F+F+F+F rules : F → FF+F+F+F+FF  Five iterations of this system yield this:\nHTML/SVG version\nCrystal Fractal axiom : F+F+F+F rules : F → FF+F++F+F  Like the Box above, this one also starts with a square (F+F+F+F). Six iterations yield:\nHTML/SVG version\nHilbert Curve axiom : X rules : X → +YF-XFX-FY+ Y → -XF+YFY+FX-  The Hilbert curve is a well-known space-filling fractal. It does get quite dense rather quickly. After only 9 iterations, it looks like this.\nHTML/SVG version (LARGE FILE!)\nZooming in a bit, we can better discern the structure:\nKoch Curve axiom : F+F+F+F rules : F → FF+F+F+F+FF  This one also becomes complex very quickly. At four iterations, it looks like this:\nHTML/SVG version\nKoch Snowflake axiom : F--F--F rules : F → F+F--F+F  This is another well-known fractal.\nHTML/SVG version\nRings axiom : F+F+F+F rules : F → FF+F+F+F+F+F-F  This one is quite eye-catching. After six itertations, we get:\nHTML/SVG version\nSierpiński Triangle axiom : F-G-G rules : F → F-G+F+G-F G → GG  The Sierpiński triangle is another very well known fractal. Unlike the ones seen above, it has two forward variables, F and G. After 8 iterations, it results in this:\nMore to Come! In this post we have covered the basics of L-system based fractals. There is a bit more to them, as more \"commands\" can be embedded in the fractal string, such as moving the turtle without drawing, and pushing and popping state onto a stack, to allow for the generation of more complex patterns. The L-system processing code on Github has some partial support for those, but the renderer doesn't, so some further work is needed there.\nA second part to this incursion into fractals is upcoming. There we'll look into two different types of fractals. The first type is based on affine transformations and stochastic processes, and the second one is the famous Mandelbrot set.\n","date":1506408223,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1506408223,"objectID":"79d6fbc5b9e7996b350c65fb1be8476d","permalink":"https://martin.varela.fi/2017/09/26/fractals-complexity-from-simplicity-and-a-bit-of-clojure/","publishdate":"2017-09-26T09:43:43+03:00","relpermalink":"/2017/09/26/fractals-complexity-from-simplicity-and-a-bit-of-clojure/","section":"post","summary":"Enter the Dragon Fractals have always fascinated me.

The folks at Codisec have developed a tool called Veles for visualizing binary files. The idea is to help detect patterns in the data, which in some cases are useful for e.g,. security-related analysis.\nThe technique described was surprisingly simple, in that it looks at digrams or trigrams in the file, and then it analyses their frequency and spatial distribution within the data. This is not unlike the use of n-grams in computational linguistics, or k-mers in computational genomics. The idea is to analyze and model sequences of elements (be it words, phonemes, or DNA bases). A fun application of this type of analysis is the creation of Markov chain text generators, which use the probability distribution of n-grams in a text corpus to synthesize text with similar characteristics. A couple of popular examples of these generators is the creation of parody post-modernist writings, or bogus scientific papers (many of which have been accepted to predatory conferences and journals, to the amusement and dismay of many).\nBasically, the approach taken in Veles is to take byte trigrams of the form $(i, i+1, i+2)$ from the file, and use them to represent points in a 3D space (a digram-based 2D version is also described). Being sequences of bytes, the space is limited to a 256x256x256 cube. The Veles visualization uses luminance to represent the (normalized) frequency of each point in the file, resulting in very nice-looking, and surprisingly structured visualizations. The tool also assigns different hues to points, based on their position in the file (which is divided into 256 equally-sized bins for this purpose).\nA Simple Take on Binary Visualization In this post, I'll show how a similar type of visualization can be simply created in a few lines of R, using ggplot2. We'll make 2d plots instead of the (admittedly nicer looking) 3d ones that Veles does, but similar information about the structure of the files can be gleaned from them.\nGetting Our Data in Shape Our data will be the bytes in the file, repeated twice next to each other with an offset of one for each repetition. This is a common pattern for example in Haskell and Lisp, basically zip 'ping a list with its own tail. In R, we can use the lead or lag functions provided in Hadley Wickham's dplyr package.\nlibrary(tidyverse) a \u0026lt;- 1:10 lead(a)  Loading tidyverse: ggplot2 Loading tidyverse: tibble Loading tidyverse: tidyr Loading tidyverse: readr Loading tidyverse: purrr Loading tidyverse: dplyr Conflicts with tidy packages --------------------------------------------------- filter(): dplyr, stats lag(): dplyr, stats [1] 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 NA  We can see that lead has shifted a to the left, introducing a NA value at the end. If we create a dataframe or tibble with a, lead(a) and lead(lead(a)) , we will obtain a table of trigrams.\nzipped \u0026lt;- as.tibble(cbind(a, lead(a), lead(a,2))) glimpse(zipped)  Observations: 10 Variables: 3 $ a  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 $ ``  2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, NA $ ``  3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, NA, NA  This is close to what we need, except for the NA values, which we can easily remove with drop_na, na.omit, or filter.\nzipped %\u0026gt;% drop_na()  # A tibble: 8 x 3 a `` ``    1 1 2 3 2 2 3 4 3 3 4 5 4 4 5 6 5 5 6 7 6 6 7 8 7 7 8 9 8 8 9 10  Plotting We will use a basic scatter plot to visualize our data. In order to make up for the lack of a third dimension in the plots, we will use a couple of tricks to add more information. First, we'll use a low alpha value, which will help us get a notion of density in the plot (we'll later add actual density plots, too). The more times an $(x,y)$ pair (corresponding to bytes $(i,i+1)$ in the file) is found in the data, the more opaque it'll show on the scatter plot. Second, we'll use the $z$ (corresponding to byte $i+2$) to determine the color of the point. In this way, we will pack more information into the plot. We will also discuss other possible alternatives for visualizing this information at the end of the post.\nFor the time being, we won't consider the location within the file, though as we will see, it would be simple to add this information as well.\nLet us quickly see how we can setup the visualization.\nx \u0026lt;- sample(0:255, size=50000, replace = TRUE) y \u0026lt;- lead(x) z \u0026lt;- lead(x,2) data \u0026lt;- cbind(x,y,z) %\u0026gt;% as.tibble() %\u0026gt;% na.omit() binplot \u0026lt;- data %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_point(mapping = aes(color = z), alpha = 1/20) + scale_color_gradient(low=\u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;, high=\u0026quot;orange\u0026quot;) + ggsave(\u0026quot;testplot.png\u0026quot;)  Saving 7 x 7 in image  We can now look at the resulting plot:\nThe plot does not look like much, because we sampled uniformly distributed random data. However, if we read a file with some structure, we will see something more interesting. For some extra \"meta-ness\", we'll use the source for this post as an input.\nfilesize \u0026lt;- file.size(\u0026quot;post_draft.org\u0026quot;) x \u0026lt;- readBin(\u0026quot;post_draft.org\u0026quot;, integer(), n=filesize, size = 1, signed = FALSE) y \u0026lt;- lead(x) z \u0026lt;- lead(x,2) data \u0026lt;- as.tibble(cbind(x,y,z)) %\u0026gt;% na.omit() binplot \u0026lt;- data %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_point(mapping = aes(color = z), alpha = 1/20) + scale_color_gradient(low=\u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;, high=\u0026quot;orange\u0026quot;, limits = c(0,255)) + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,255), ylim = c(0, 255)) ggsave(\u0026quot;testplot2.png\u0026quot;)  Saving 7 x 7 in image  Now this is a bit more interesting! What we can see here, is that most of the data is confined to a small section of our space. In particular, we can see both from the points' color, and areas where points appear, that most values are in the ASCII range (which is to be expected, this mostly being English text, and ASCII codes stay the same even in an UTF-8 encoded file), with most trigrams comprising characters in the (97—122) range, corresponding to [a-z] (and to a lesser degree those in [A-z] ) and spaces (32). Where we see more transparent points, we can infer the presence of punctuation and tokens found in the R code and org-mode mark-up.\nIn some cases, using a different coordinate system may be useful in distinguishing structure. We can use, for instance, polar coordinates.\npolar_plot \u0026lt;- binplot + coord_polar() ggsave(\u0026quot;testplot2_polar.png\u0026quot;)  Saving 7 x 7 in image  Here we can also clearly see the predominance of digrams in the [A-z] range, and of combinations of those and spaces (the line pointing towards 32 in the NE quadrant, and the segment of arc at 32 in the NW quadrant).\nWe can also think about looking purely at the density of digrams. To this end, we use a different geometry and stat in our plot.\ndens_plot \u0026lt;- data %\u0026gt;% ggplot(mapping = aes(x,y)) + stat_density2d(aes(fill = ..density..), geom=\u0026quot;raster\u0026quot;, contour = FALSE) + scale_fill_gradient(low=\u0026quot;steelblue4\u0026quot;, high=\u0026quot;sienna2\u0026quot;) + coord_fixed(ratio = 1) ggsave(\u0026quot;testplot2_density.png\u0026quot;)  Saving 7 x 7 in image  In this case, the density plot does not provide much additional information, but it could be useful if we were for instance to facet the plot based on where in the file the digrams occur, or in more complex files, where the trigram-based coloring may obscure some of the structure.\nThe density plot is also more resource-intensive, and when dealing with large files, it may be desirable to work only on parts of the data, even for the basic trigram-based plots. In order to do this, we can uniformly sample the data, and thus obtain a lower resolution, but still informative view of it.\nA More Complete Solution Before putting this to practice with larger, more complex files, let us put the ideas for processing and visualizing the data into a bit more complete form in R code.\nWe will create a small set of functions that allow us to play around with these kinds of visualizations, and output the plots with an automated and systematic naming scheme, which we could use for automatic report generation or some such at a later stage.\nlibrary(tidyverse) # binviz Veles-like binary visualizaiton binViz2d \u0026lt;- function(filename, alpha = 1/100, maxsize = 5000000, save = TRUE, polar = FALSE, sample = FALSE, sample_size = 2000000, do_density = FALSE){ # setting dens_plot as NA simplifies the logic below a bit dens_plot = NA # we read the file as a stream of bytes, and prepare our tibble # We'll add a column indexing the trigram position in the file # This will come in handy later if we want to facet the plot by position # as done in the Veles article. We'll just mutate binViz here, to save memory. rawdata \u0026lt;- readBin(filename, integer(), n=maxsize, size = 1, signed = FALSE) size \u0026lt;- rawdata %\u0026gt;% as.tibble %\u0026gt;% nrow binViz \u0026lt;- cbind(0:(size - 1),rawdata, lead(rawdata), lead(rawdata,n=2L)) colnames(binViz) \u0026lt;- c('idx', 'x', 'y', 'z') # We then remove any missing values from the dataset toplot \u0026lt;- binViz %\u0026gt;% as.tibble %\u0026gt;% na.omit # If sampling is required, we do it now. Sampling is important # if doing the density plots, as going beyond 1M points gets SLOW if(sample){ toplot \u0026lt;- toplot %\u0026gt;% sample_n(min(count(toplot), sample_size)) } # The actual plotting theplot \u0026lt;- binViz2d_do_plot(toplot, alpha, polar) + ggtitle(title_spec(filename, sample, sample_size)) if(do_density){ dens_plot \u0026lt;- binViz2d_do_density_plot(toplot, polar) } # Saving the plots if(save){ namespec \u0026lt;- name_spec(filename, sample, sample_size, polar) binViz2d_save(namespec, theplot, dens_plot) } return(list(binViz_plot = theplot, dens_plot = dens_plot)) }  The main functionality of our code is succinctly described in the binViz2d function above. It takes a number of parameters, summarized in the table below:\n   Parameter Name Description     filename File to visualize   alpha Alpha level (transparency) of the dots (lower values are useful for larger files)   maxsize Maximum number of bytes to read from the file, if not sampling   save Determines whether the plot should be saved to a file   polar Determines whether the plot should use polar coordinates   sample Determines whether the file should be sampled   sample_size The number of samples to take, if sampling   do_density Whether to do an additional density plot (sampling is strongly advised    The function returns the visualization and density plots (note that the density plot may be NA) in a list (this list can be easily destructured using the zeallot package).\nThe main plotting functions are as follows.\nbinViz2d_do_plot \u0026lt;- function(data, alpha, polar){ theplot \u0026lt;- data %\u0026gt;% ggplot(mapping = aes(x,y)) + geom_point(mapping = aes(color=z), alpha = alpha, size = 0.75) + scale_color_gradient(low=\u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;, high=\u0026quot;orange\u0026quot;) + coord_fixed(ratio = 1)+ labs(x=\u0026quot;i\u0026quot;, y=\u0026quot;i+1\u0026quot;, z=\u0026quot;i+2\u0026quot;) if(polar){ theplot \u0026lt;- theplot + coord_polar() } return(theplot) } binViz2d_do_density_plot \u0026lt;- function(toplot, polar){ dens_plot \u0026lt;- toplot %\u0026gt;% ggplot(mapping = aes(x,y)) + stat_density2d(aes(fill = ..density..), geom=\u0026quot;raster\u0026quot;, contour = FALSE) + scale_fill_gradient(low=\u0026quot;steelblue4\u0026quot;, high=\u0026quot;sienna2\u0026quot;) + coord_fixed(ratio = 1)+ labs(x=\u0026quot;i\u0026quot;, y=\u0026quot;i+1\u0026quot;) return(dens_plot) }  These are pretty much the same as we had done above, only in function form.\nThe remaining auxiliary functions take care of generating suitable titles and filenames, as well as saving the plots.\ntitle_spec \u0026lt;- function(name, sampled, nsamples){ if(sampled){ title \u0026lt;- paste(name, \u0026quot;-\u0026quot;, nsamples, \u0026quot;samples.\u0026quot;) }else{ title \u0026lt;- name } return(title) } # We create a name separated by underscores, this simplifies later parsing # of file names, if needed, to automate e.g., reports creation name_spec \u0026lt;- function(name, sampled, nsamples, polar){ polar_str \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;\u0026quot; if(polar){ polar_str \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;polar\u0026quot; } sampled_str \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;\u0026quot; if(sampled){ sampled_str \u0026lt;- paste(\u0026quot;sampled\u0026quot;, nsamples, sep=\u0026quot;_\u0026quot;) } basename \u0026lt;- chartr('/.', '::', paste(\u0026quot;plot\u0026quot;, polar_str, sampled_str, name, sep = \u0026quot;_\u0026quot;)) return(paste(basename, \u0026quot;.png\u0026quot;, sep=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;)) } binViz2d_save \u0026lt;- function(namespec, binViz_plot, dens_plot){ png(namespec, width = 15, height = 15, units = \u0026quot;cm\u0026quot;, res = 300) print(binViz_plot) dev.off() if(!is.na(dens_plot)){ png(paste(\u0026quot;density\u0026quot;,namespec,sep=\u0026quot;_\u0026quot;), width = 15, height = 15, units = \u0026quot;cm\u0026quot;, res = 300) print(dens_plot) dev.off() } }  Like this, in under 100 lines of R (under 75 if removing comments and blank lines), we can create nice and informative visualization for binary data.\nGoing a Bit Further As mentioned above, the Veles solution does some nice things, such as coloring points based on their location in the file, and also they do a tomography-like view of the 2d digram plot, by layering the plots for different parts of the file on top of each other.\nWe can achieve comparable effects by adding facets to our plots. In the code above, we have added some meta-data in the form of an index column. We can use that column to create a cut of the data, and then facet on this.\n#let's load the code we wrote above source(\u0026quot;binViz2d/binViz2d.r\u0026quot;) library(zeallot) c(p,d) %\u0026lt;-% binViz2d(\u0026quot;post_draft.org\u0026quot;, save=FALSE) fp \u0026lt;- p + facet_wrap(~cut(idx, 10, labels=FALSE)) ggsave(\u0026quot;testplot2_faceted_idx.png\u0026quot;, width = 20, height = 20, units = \u0026quot;cm\u0026quot;)  Loading tidyverse: ggplot2 Loading tidyverse: tibble Loading tidyverse: tidyr Loading tidyverse: readr Loading tidyverse: purrr Loading tidyverse: dplyr Conflicts with tidy packages --------------------------------------------------- filter(): dplyr, stats lag(): dplyr, stats  Adding the facets to the plot allows us to see how the structure of the file varies along its length. For this case, there isn't a noticeable difference, since the file is just text.\nWe can do another neat thing, which is to facet on the value of the z byte in the trigram, and that will show us the densities of different levels in the file contents. In the case of this post draft, we should be able to see areas with\nc(p,d) %\u0026lt;-% binViz2d(\u0026quot;post_draft.org\u0026quot;, save=FALSE) lp \u0026lt;- p + facet_wrap(~cut(z, 10)) ggsave(\u0026quot;testplot2_faceted_value.png\u0026quot;, width = 20, height = 20, units = \u0026quot;cm\u0026quot;)  Here we can clearly see again that most of the file's contents seems to fall in the ASCII range, with concentrations of space characters, and other characters in the [A-z] range, plus some occurrences of punctuation.\nMore Interesting Examples More interesting examples of this type of visualization are possible when looking at more complex files. Below we show a few of these.\nExecutable Code and Libraries The plots below show the structure of (Darwin) executable and library files.\nbinViz2d(\u0026quot;emacsclient\u0026quot;, alpha=1/20) binViz2d(\u0026quot;libasan.4.dylib\u0026quot;, alpha=1/150) binViz2d(\u0026quot;libR.dylib\u0026quot;, alpha=1/150)  We can see that these files have more structure to them, and exhibit some common patterns, such as much higher frequencies for low values and values corresponding to upper-case ASCII characters, as well as a significant amount of points in the [a-z] range, as well. Looking at the strings in those binaries, we can find very many upper-case constant names, along with e.g., error messages, which help explain the observed value distribution.\nFor a different perspective, we can look at the polar projection of one of these plots.\nbinViz2d(\u0026quot;libR.dylib\u0026quot;, alpha=1/150, polar=TRUE)  We can also look at a faceted version of a plot, looking at how the trigrams change throughout the file.\nc(p,d) %\u0026lt;-% binViz2d(\u0026quot;emacsclient\u0026quot;, save=FALSE) lp \u0026lt;- p + facet_wrap(~cut(idx, 20)) ggsave(\u0026quot;emacsclient_faceted_idx.png\u0026quot;, width = 20, height = 20, units = \u0026quot;cm\u0026quot;)  PDF Content PDF files show very distinctive properties as well. Here we look at a scientific paper and a programming book.\nbinViz2d(\u0026quot;tommSurvey.pdf\u0026quot;, alpha=1/150) binViz2d(\u0026quot;cookbook.pdf\u0026quot;, alpha=1/150)  We notice that there are quite striking similarities among the plots. In particular, a set of \"lines\" appear along the main diagonal of the plot, and from the (0,0) and (255,255) points towards the mid-range of each axis. As expected, there's also a large concentration of trigrams in the character parts of the ASCII range.\nWe can look at a faceted view of the plot to see if the distribution changes either on the index or the values observed.\nc(p,d) %\u0026lt;-% binViz2d(\u0026quot;tommSurvey.pdf\u0026quot;, save=FALSE) lp \u0026lt;- p + facet_wrap(~cut(z, 12)) ggsave(\u0026quot;tommSurvey_faceted_value.png\u0026quot;, width = 20, height = 20, units = \u0026quot;cm\u0026quot;) ip \u0026lt;- p + facet_wrap(~cut(idx, 12)) ggsave(\u0026quot;tommSurvey_faceted_idx.png\u0026quot;, width = 20, height = 20, units = \u0026quot;cm\u0026quot;)  When looking at how the line structure is noticeable throughout the file, we can see that there are portions of the file in which it vanishes, whereas in others it (or a part of it) becomes more prominent.\nLooking at the values below, however, shows that a) all the range of values is nearly uniformly represented throughout the file, and b) the main diagonal line structure is noticeable for all the value ranges, but the secondary ones are visible only in certain value ranges. Finding out the actual meaning of this would probably be a non-trivial task, left as an exercise to the reader ;).\nAudio When looking at media files, which tend to be large, it is good to try sampling the content, in order to reduce the time (and memory) required for creating the visualizations. We will look at a music clip, uncompressed, and then encoded as MP3 and FLAC.\nbinViz2d(\u0026quot;Test_File_2_0_STEREO_PCM.wav\u0026quot;, alpha=1/100, sample = TRUE, sample_size = 400000) binViz2d(\u0026quot;Test_File_2_0_STEREO_MP3.mp3\u0026quot;, alpha=1/100, sample = TRUE, sample_size = 400000) binViz2d(\u0026quot;Test_File_2_0_STEREO_FLAC.flac\u0026quot;, alpha=1/100, sample = TRUE, sample_size = 400000)  We note that the relative resolution of each plot will be different, as we are sampling the same amount of data out of files of very different size. In the case of the uncompressed audio, the sample is less than 1% of the total file, whereas for the FLAC it's a bit under 5 percent, and for the MP3 version it is almost 20 percent. Still, the patterns observed in the plots are quite constant, even varying the sampling size between 25% and 500% of the value chosen here.\nIt's interesting to note that while the uncompressed file has a very clear structure, the compressed versions seem almost random.

Between the compressed versions, it seems like the FLAC-encoded one shows less structure than the MP3-encoded one, where some patches of the space are denser.

Indeed, being able to predict how users perceive the quality of a service allows the service provider(s) to optimize its delivery, based on several possible criteria.

For instance, the most commonly used measure of QoE is the aptly-called Mean Opinion Score (MOS), which is intended to represent an idealized average subject’s rating of the quality. Another form of averaging occurs when choosing and preparing the samples used for the assessment, which are supposed to be representative of an average viewing situation. This leads to nice, smooth scalar representations of quality, but at the same time, it leads to a loss of information. In this paper we present a first step towards working with all the information available in an explicit way, rather than averaging it away. We do so in the context of constructing layered quality models for HTTP video streaming (using Dynamic Adaptive HTTP Streaming — DASH, excluding its adaptation feature at this stage), mapping network-level QoS measurements to probability distributions of different MOS values for a given set of conditions.","tags":null,"title":"Embracing Uncertainty: A Probabilistic View of HTTP Video Quality","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tobias Hoßfeld","Poul Einar Heegaard","Lea Skorin-Kapov","Martín Varela"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483414842,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483414842,"objectID":"6a39a4cea825417b615c7573cb93ae21","permalink":"https://martin.varela.fi/publication/varela-qoe-fairness/","publishdate":"2017-01-03T06:40:42+03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/varela-qoe-fairness/","section":"publication","summary":"User-centric service and application management focuses on the Quality of Experience (QoE) as perceived by the end user.

The contribution of this paper is the definition of a generic QoE fairness index $F$ which has desirable key properties as well as the rationale behind it. By using examples and a measurement study involving multiple users downloading web content over a bottleneck link, we differentiate the proposed index from QoS fairness and the widely used Jain’s fairness index. Based on results, we argue that neither QoS fairness nor Jain’s fairness index meet all of the desirable QoE-relevant properties which are met by $F$.

For service and content providers in particular, it is more interesting to have an idea of how the scores are distributed, so as to ensure that a certain portion of the user population is experiencing satisfactory levels of quality, thus reducing churn.

For communication networks, however, there is a major interest from different stakeholders to have multi-dimensional QoE models. The contribution of this paper is an analysis of the generic relationship between QoS and QoE for multiple QoS parameters and its implications. We address the question of whether multi-dimensional QoE models for several parameters are additive or multiplicative. In an analytic model and with examples involving HTTP non-adaptive video streaming, we show that a multiplicative model has different properties than the current additive QoE model proposed in ITU-T standards.

Hence, we investigate various ideas to exploit QoE awareness for improving SLAs (ranging from internal aspects like SLOs by service providers to completely novel definitions of ELAs which are able to characterize QoE explicitly), and discuss important problems and challenges of the proposed transition as well.","tags":null,"title":"From Service Level Agreements (SLA) to Experience Level Agreements (ELA): The Challenges of Selling QoE to the User","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Doreid Ammar","Martín Varela"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1433302840,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1433302840,"objectID":"5a282b07799ad0f3a1714fa48c8c8125","permalink":"https://martin.varela.fi/publication/varela-iwqos2015/","publishdate":"2015-06-03T06:40:40+03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/varela-iwqos2015/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we introduce a novel QoE-aware routing approach for video streams.

The main goal of the seminar was to strengthen and go beyond the current understanding on Quality of Experience (QoE) and its assessment, in order to start tackling the logical yet highly challenging next steps: to move from assessment to application and to translate insights on QoE and knowledge from this research field into forms of economic and/or societal value. This report contains the personal statements and main challenges brought forward by the participants, who were on the fly clustered into six main discussion topics.

While useful, the limitations of MOS are evident even in its name; for many applications, just having a mean value is simply not enough. For service providers in particular, it would be more interesting to have an idea of how the scores are distributed, so as to ensure that a certain portion of the user population is experiencing satisfactory levels of quality, thus reducing churn. In this paper we propose different statistical measures to express important aspects of QoE beyond MOS like user diversity, uncertainty of user rating distributions, ratio of dissatisfied users. Further, we propose a way to use MOS values and the standard deviation of opinion scores (SOS) hypothesis, which postulates a quadratic relation between subjective scores and their standard deviation, in order to derive quantiles for subjective ratings.","tags":null,"title":"QoE Beyond the MOS: Added Value Using Quantiles and Distributions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martín Varela","Toni Mäki","Lea Skorin-Kapov","Tobias Hoßfeld"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1430624443,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1430624443,"objectID":"a5876539e56817a10545b57c0112b4ad","permalink":"https://martin.varela.fi/publication/varela-qomex2015-1/","publishdate":"2015-05-03T06:40:43+03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/varela-qomex2015-1/","section":"publication","summary":"Web services and applications are an increasingly pervasive ﬁxture of modern life and business.

For end-users,the quality of experience (QoE), and consequently the underlying quality of service (QoS) are the most meaningful criteria for triggering handovers and selecting target base stations. However, difficulties in reliably measuring quality real-time have resulted in many QoS/QoE based mobility solutions being impractical. We propose a network information service that allows mobile devices to find suitable nearby base stations by indicating their capability to satisfy the required service level. Information services allow end systems to discover heterogeneous networks at or near their location. However, the current solutions do not enable assessing base station availability and their quality of service in different locations reliably enough. In our solution, end system performed QoS measurement (and possibly QoE estimation) results are stored in a spatial database within the information service as polygon geometries. Through a single query to the information service end systems can find a sufficient amount of information about base stations in range to make handover target decisions on quality of service basis. We observe that the solution can achieve quality improvements of up to 50% in dense heterogeneous networks.","tags":null,"title":"A Network Information Service for Quality-Driven Mobility","type":"publication"},{"authors":["ETSI SQT"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1417694419,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1417694419,"objectID":"1d6b4bb9860d1942ec07384cc003c3ca","permalink":"https://martin.varela.fi/publication/etsi-ts-103294/","publishdate":"2014-12-04T15:00:19+03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/etsi-ts-103294/","section":"publication","summary":"This ETSI TS describes an agent-based, modular, distributed architecture for QoE monitoring.

We then focus on the application of this mapping in the context of networked media services by adhering to a layered approach for modeling QoE dimensions in relation to the aforementioned QoE-affecting factors. Such an approach facilitates understanding a service’s QoE as a composite function of the performance of the underlying network, and the actual service implementation, under constraints imposed by some of the QoE-affecting factors.

Traditionally, the focus lies on how multi-level quality features are perceived by a human user. The interest has however gradually expanded towards human cognitive, affective and behavioral processes that may impact on, be an element of, or be influenced by QoE, and which have been underinvestigated so far. In addition, there is a major discrepancy between the new, broadly supported and more holistic conceptualization of QoE proposed by Le Callet et al. (2012) and traditional, standardized QoE assessment. This paper explores ways to tackle this discrepancy by means of a multi-instrumental approach. More concretely, it presents results from a lab study on video quality (N=27), aimed at going beyond the dominant QoE assessment paradigm and at exploring affective aspects in relation to QoE and in relation to perceived overall quality. Four types of data were collected: ‘traditional’ QoE self-report measures were complemented with ‘alternative’, emotional stateand user engagement-related self-report measures to evaluate QoE. In addition, we collected EEG (physiological) data, gazetracking data and facial expressions (behavioral) data. The video samples used in test were longer in duration than is common in standard tests allowing us to study e.g. more realistic experience and deeper user engagement. Our findings support the claim that the traditional QoE measures need to be reconsidered and extended with additional, affective staterelated measures.","tags":null,"title":"Chamber QoE - A Multi-instrumental Apporach to Explore Affective Aspects in relation to Quality of Experience","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martín Varela","Toni Mäki","Lea Skorin-Kapov","Tobias Hoßfeld"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1378179642,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1378179642,"objectID":"b3c25a5fb43d774792a256cda5f5c1f5","permalink":"https://martin.varela.fi/publication/varela-pqs13/","publishdate":"2013-09-03T06:40:42+03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/varela-pqs13/","section":"publication","summary":"A commonly cited maxim states that “you get what you pay for”, implying that there is a strong correlation between the price paid for something, and its quality.

However, managing the satisfaction level of customers to provide a good user experience is not being an easy task due to the complexity of orchestrating network and customer data sources.

To this end, a variety of quality prediction models has been developed. The models are typically built and trained based on data acquired from user studies conducted in laboratories with precisely defined conditions. While laboratory originated data is accurate and reliable, the performance of Quality of Experience (QoE) models could be possibly further improved by taking into account the real context of use. Working towards that goal, in this paper, we compare results of a laboratory audiovisual quality subjective study and two smaller scale user studies conducted in public place.

The primary reason is that streaming services consume more than half of the total bandwidth. Before designing new concepts and solutions it is fundamental to understand in detail the performance and behavior of multimedia applications for the mobile access. For this reason we have carried out several field experiments to obtain knowledge about typical bandwidth consumption, ability to adapt video bit-rate to changed network conditions, protocol and other service speciﬁc issues for the most popular over-the-top and managed video services. We have detected that observed data rates apart from the video encoding and the speciﬁc content also depend on client and server implementations. Surprisingly, support for rate adaptation in current implementations of managed and over-the-top streaming services is not very common, in some cases with limited feature set. From the obtained results we conclude that measurements need to continue with a shift from ﬁeld experiments to lab environment in order to obtain further knowledge of streaming characteristics, which could not be revealed in the current measurements","tags":null,"title":"Analysis of Managed and Over-the-Top Streaming Services in Mobile Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lea Skorin-Kapov","Martín Varela"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1336016441,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1336016441,"objectID":"7a34dd121a562502e638f18691f2fb7a","permalink":"https://martin.varela.fi/publication/varela-mipro12/","publishdate":"2012-05-03T06:40:41+03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/varela-mipro12/","section":"publication","summary":"Understanding and modeling the wide range of influence factors that impact end user Quality of Experience (QoE) and go beyond traditional Quality of Service (QoS) parameters has become an important issue for service and network providers, in particular for new and emerging services.

However, the number of potentially affecting factors is typically higher, and their joint effect on quality is complex. In this paper we study the combined effects of bit rate, forward error correction, loss rate, loss distribution, delay and jitter on the perceived conversational quality. In order to achieve this we use the Pseudo-Subjective Quality Assessment (PSQA) technique, which allows us to obtain accurate, subjective–like assessments, in real time if necessary. Our contributions are thus two–fold: firstly, we offer a detailed analysis of the impact of these parameters and their interactions on the perceived conversational quality.

The current Internet infrastructure was not designed with these types of applications in mind, so traditionally, the quality of such services has not been optimal. Moreover, it can be said that most of the QoS–related problems are currently found in the access networks, and not in the core or in the local area networks (LANs). The recent explosion in the number of homes with broad- band connections, coupled with the development of wireless technologies such as IEEE 802.11, and new services being currently marketed might soon change that situation. As more and more devices are networked, we may see a new bottleneck, namely the wireless LAN (WLAN). The most widely deployed wireless technologies for home networks are currently IEEE 802.11b and 802.11g, which provide nominal top bandwidths of 11 and 54Mbps respectively. To a lesser extent, there are also Bluetooth connected devices, which can work at about 2Mbps in good conditions. In practice, the best throughputs normally observed in wi–fi networks range from 4–5Mbps for 802.11b to 20-25Mbps for 802.11g. Besides, the network performance varies depending on the topology of the network, environmental parameters, and interference from other equipment. These performances are low, and particularly unstable when compared to Ethernet LANs, but the lack of cabling makes wireless networking an attractive option for home use nonetheless.

It is therefore necessary to develop mechanisms able to improve the quality of these services, and there is indeed an important ongoing world–wide research effort in this direction. In order to effectively implement the aforementioned mechanisms, it is important to understand how the perceived quality of each application is affected by network conditions and applicative parameters. In this dissertation, we develop on a recent quality assessment technique, which we call Pseudo–Subjective Quality Assessment (PSQA), which is able to accurately estimate the quality as perceived by the application users. Moreover, it can provide precise estimations of quality in real–time, which no other technique currently found in the literature can do. Our first contribution concerns an in–depth study of PSQA and its performance, and how it compares to the other available assessment mechanisms. We then go on to provide a detailed analysis of the quality of VoIP as a function of several parameters, both network and application–level. We study both one–way and interactive flows, and consider wired and wireless networking contexts. The third contribution of this dissertation is a technique to integrate PSQA with other performance evaluation techniques, such as queuing models. This approach allows network designers to obtain a high–level view of the quality of service of the network being designed or dimensioned. Our fourth contribution concerns the development of quality–driven dynamic control mechanisms for multimedia applications, based on the real–time assessment capabilities of PSQA. We propose two proof–of–concept algorithms for control of one–way VoIP flows, and show how to extend them for interactive VoIP. We also propose quality–enhancing techniques for VoIP in a wireless context, including a simple priority scheme for the wireless link.

There is also an important increase in the number of broadband–connected homes, and many new services are being deployed by broadband providers, such as TV and VoIP. The home network is thus becoming the “media hub” of the house. This trend is expected to continue, and to expand into the Consumer Electronics (CE) market as well. This means new devices that can tap into the network in order to get their data, such as wireless TV sets, gaming consoles, tablet PCs, etc. As more and more devices are networked, we may see a new bottleneck, namely the wireless LAN (WLAN). The most widely deployed wireless technologies for home networks are currently IEEE 802.11b and 802.11g, which provide nominal top bandwidths of 11 and 54Mbps respectively. To a lesser extent, there are also Bluetooth connected devices, which can work at about 2Mbps in good conditions. In practice, the throughputs observed in wi–fi networks range from 4–5Mbps for 802.11b to 20-25Mbps to 802.11g. Besides, the network performance varies depending on the topology of the network, environmental parameters, and interference from other equipment. These performances are low when compared to current Ethernet LANs (100Mbps – 1Gbps), but the lack of cabling makes wireless networking an attractive option for home use. As new devices, applications and services continue to be developed, it is very likely that the load imposed on the network will increase, shifting the bottleneck from the access network to the wireless links. Besides the limited bandwidth available in wi–fi, the nature of wireless networks is such that their performance is very variable. Impairments due to the position of the hosts, multi-path propagation, hosts with weaker signal strength, etc. might drastically decrease the network’s performance at any time. This in turn implies a strong variability in the perceived quality of real–time applications such as voice streams, which may have a big impact on the adoption of these new technologies. In this paper we study the quality of VoIP flows in the context described above. To this end, we propose a stochastic model for the wi–fi network, which closely mimics its performance variations. In order to perform the quality assessments, we couple this model with a Neural Network–based quality assessment tool [1, 2], which provides MOS results that correlate very well with human perception.","tags":null,"title":"Wireless VoIP at Home: Are We There Yet?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martín Varela"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1109821244,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1109821244,"objectID":"994f4b8a85aedb221f5b096c02e95719","permalink":"https://martin.varela.fi/publication/varela-stw05/","publishdate":"2005-03-03T06:40:44+03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/varela-stw05/","section":"publication","summary":"In recent years, the growth of the Internet has spawned a whole new generation of networked real–time multimedia applications, such as VoIP, video-conferencing, video on demand, music streaming, etc. which have very specific, and stringent, requirements in terms of network QoS.

Those two codecs were WM9 and Helix 9 (Real), tested at two different modes and bit-rates.\n A dedicated network simulator was used in collaboration with the IRISA institute (Rennes 1 university), who developed this tool. This network simulator is accurately described in the paper. The network perturbations considered were packet losses (the parameters used were the loss rate and the mean burst size), delay and jitter. All these four parameters were adjusted independently allowing for different combinations of network parameter values. Many configurations were generated and a large amount of time was spent in order to listen carefully to the different impact on the overall quality of the codecs. Eventually, six configurations that yielded six distinctly different quality levels were kept to run the quality tests. The kept parameters values are commonly found in actual IP networks. As the goal of the audio tests was to assess the quality, the subjective audio test methodology used was the one known as MUSHRA. That stands for MUlti Stimuli with Hidden Reference and Anchor points. This is a method dedicated to the assessment of intermediate quality. It has been recommended at the ITU-R under the name BS.1534 [1]. An important feature of this method is the inclusion of the hidden reference and specific signals as anchor points along the quality scale. The objective of the test was to observe the \"quality behaviour\" of the two mentioned codecs at two different bit rates in a simulated network environment. Consequently, the anchor points were the two codecs at a given bit rate without any simulated network, and the full band reference.\n Results presented in the paper are of interest not only because they show the specific weakness of the two codecs when faced with network perturbations but also because they show a specific use of the MUSHRA method, which makes these kinds of tests possible.","tags":null,"title":"Subjective Audio Tests: Quality of a Selection of Codecs When Used in IP Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Samir Mohamed","Gerardo Rubino","Martín Varela"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1080963641,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1080963641,"objectID":"88f34359f309316b6cabee89181fbbe5","permalink":"https://martin.varela.fi/publication/varela-performance-evaluation/","publishdate":"2004-04-03T06:40:41+03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/varela-performance-evaluation/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper addresses the problem of quantitatively evaluating the quality of a speech stream transported over the Internet as perceived by the end-user.

That work is concerned with object sharing and proposes an approach to solve some of the problems that arise in the object sharing model proposed in the JavaCard 2.1 specification.","tags":null,"title":"A Simple Methodology for Secure Object Sharing","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
