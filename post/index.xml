      <description>Beyond L-Systems In the first part of this post, we went over Lindenmayer systems, and saw how from small sets of very simple rules, complexity emerged in the form of intricate patterns. In this part, we will look at two other types of fractals. The first one, is called the Barnsley fern, and unlike the L-systems in the previous post, it is based not on string substitution, but on the repeated iteration of affine transformations to a starting point.</description>

      <description>Enter the Dragon Fractals have always fascinated me. I remember seeing a render of a Mandelbrot set back in the early 90s (when color screens started being accessible back home), and being completely mesmerized by it. I remember being even more fascinated by seeing a code-golf version of such a renderer, implemented in some 300 bytes of C.
Some days ago I came across the &#34;dragon curve&#34;, and decided to give it a go in Clojure, as a way to learn a bit more and have some fun.</description>

      <title>Simple Binary Data Visualization</title>

      <description>Introduction A few days ago I ran across this discussion on Hacker News, which referred to this article on binary data visualization. The folks at Codisec have developed a tool called Veles for visualizing binary files. The idea is to help detect patterns in the data, which in some cases are useful for e.g,. security-related analysis.
The technique described was surprisingly simple, in that it looks at digrams or trigrams in the file, and then it analyses their frequency and spatial distribution within the data.</description>
